Now I propose to give a solution on how to solve the "magic square"
p.e. N=3
8	1	6
3	5	7
4	9	2
sum = 15

so that the vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines of length 3 (in this case) add up to the same, in the same way "take out" prints the sum that it should have...

The program must solve squares of any size, odd number and greater than 2...

p.e. N=5
17	24	1	8	15
23	5	7	14	16
4	6	13	20	22
10	12	19	21	3
11	18	25	2	9
sum  = 65

PS. The points to be evaluated are solution, clarity and efficiency....
