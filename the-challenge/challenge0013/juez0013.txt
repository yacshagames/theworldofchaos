Hello CHALLENGE followers:

Here I am sending the JUDGE solution, so you can see how simple it was... it was just putting the star in a text file, and then reading and displaying it in the program, in the purest style of loading a PCX or BMP graphic file. Although there could be other answers, such as putting the star inside the code, in a static array, but this is an unnecessary waste of memory and the code also takes up more space.

NOTE: To run the program correctly you must copy the executable into the same folder as the star.txt file.

Regards
