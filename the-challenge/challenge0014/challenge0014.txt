This challenge is not as difficult as its predecessors, but it also has its tricks. The good thing about this challenge is that you don't need to have a compiler at hand to answer it, which is why, I think, the previous challenges were not answered very often.

The challenge consists of the program providing the comparison of 2 integers entered by keyboard, for this, source code is provided already written, so the only thing missing is the code that compares the entered values ​​and then shows the respective results.

You only have to implement the USEFUL CODE LINE (*) that is dotted, without touching the code that is already written.

(*) A useful line of code in C++ is the line of code between two consecutive "semicolons".

And so that they don't get away with it so easily, you can't use if, switch, break, while, do, for and ?: .
You can't declare more variables than those that are already declared.

//SOURCE CODE TO COMPLETE

#include <iostream>
using std::cout;
using std::cin;

void main()
{
 int a,b;

 cout << "\n\nEnter integer A: ";
 cin >> a;
 cout << "\nEnter integer B: ";
 cin >> b;

 ............ ; //just complete code here

 if( a==b )
	 cout << "\n\nThey are equal numbers."; 
 else 
	 cout << "\n\nThe largest is " << a << " and the smallest is " << b << ".";
}


Good luck.
