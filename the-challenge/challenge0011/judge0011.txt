Hello again Challenge followers...

Here is the complete JUDGE solution that I promised.

Before, I want to say that all the participants in this Challenge were saying a fallacy the whole time..., well how are they going to say that "The C++ Language is the Best!!!", when their solution is in C, it doesn't make sense..., these are the contradictions of life!!! :(

That's why, and it couldn't be any other way, the JUEZ solution has to be written in C++. Well, here is the solution (attached file).

As for portability, it is not ANSI and only works using the conio.h and WinBGIDLL library.

Any suggestion, doubt or comment can be made on the list itself or to my email.

AND MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL...

Regards
