It's just a simple visual effect in text mode, which involves several words scrolling simultaneously on the screen, to eventually form a sentence. To illustrate this, I'm attaching an executable file of the finished program.

What is requested is the coding of this text effect for console mode.

Perhaps the most interesting thing in this challenge is that the source code must be as small and optimized as possible and according to this I will evaluate the winner.
