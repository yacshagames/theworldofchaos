Instructions for THE CHALLENGE

This Challenge was proposed for the now defunct C/C++ programming list CWORLD (https://web.archive.org/web/20011102010617/http://www.ciudadfutura.com/cworld/retos_anteriores.htm) in 1999.

To make it more interesting, I suggest you first try to solve it on your own. And only when you can't go on, look at the solution.

Included Files:

challengexxxx.*    -> Original statement
judgexxxx.txt -> JUDGE Solution (the solution I used to correct the participants)
judgexxxx.cpp -> Attached Source Code of the JUDGE solution (optional)
soluxxxx.cpp -> Solution sent by the winning participant (doesn't always exist)
discuxxxx.txt -> Some important discussions that arose during the development of the challenge (optional)

Good luck.
