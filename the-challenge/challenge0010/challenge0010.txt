Statement
How to pause for less than 55ms?

where:

ms = milliseconds = thousandths of a second.
The time entered must be a whole number of milliseconds.

Clarifications
As we know, the function delay, gettime, etc; depend on the time processor of our PC (Timer), which works with time units called ticks, where each tick is equivalent to approximately 55ms. The question is how to design a function that puts a pause for 1ms, 2ms,
3ms,…,55ms, 56ms, 57ms, 58ms,… onwards ; and of course… also do the coding in C/C++.

To standardize the responses, the function must have the following statement:

//Precision Delay
//mseg = número entero de milisegundos pdelay( unsigned mseg );
void pdelay( unsigned mseg );
