# NUMERICAL METHODS

These are programs that use numerical methods to solve systems of equations, differential equations, integration methods, roots of functions in 1 variable ( f(x)=0), roots of functions in 2 variables ( f(x,y)=0 ; g(x,y)=0 ) by different solution methods, and all this using a practical virtual Menu in text mode...

All the methods mentioned in this file come attached with the sources made in C++ language.
